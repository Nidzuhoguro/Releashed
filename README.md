# Description :3
Just a plugin to leash players. This is what u gooners wanted, right?

# The code is swoppy? :<
BRO I was makin' this out of pure "haha so funni I gotta make this fr fr" on no sleep with NO experience in making Bukkit plugins and it still works better than other plugins of this kind I tried.
If you want it to be better, send pull requests, please? :3

# Releases?

On the right side of the GitHub page there should be the "**Releases**" section there u can see I uploaded the release. This plugin was tested on Purpur 1.21.10 server, API level is 1.21 so it should work on any 1.21.x servers that support Bukkit plugins.
