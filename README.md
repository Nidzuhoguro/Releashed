# Description :3
Leashed players can cut the leash with shears, they also take damage when attacking those who leash them and they can be leashed to a fence just like mobs, and yes, once again, they cannot unleash themselves unless they have shears.

# The code is swoppy? :<
Bro, I was makin' this out of pure "haha so funni I gotta make this fr fr" on no sleep with NO experience in making Bukkit plugins and it still works better than other plugins of this kind I tried.
If you want it to be better, send pull requests, please? :3

Or just send your ideas/bug reports on the [**issues page**](https://github.com/Nidzuhoguro/Releashed/issues) of this repo.

# Releases?
Get 'em from the [**Releases Page**](https://github.com/Nidzuhoguro/Releashed/releases) or [**Modrinth**](https://modrinth.com/project/SE75wTRL). This plugin was tested on Purpur 1.21.10 server, API level is 1.21 so it should work on any 1.21.x servers that support Bukkit plugins.
